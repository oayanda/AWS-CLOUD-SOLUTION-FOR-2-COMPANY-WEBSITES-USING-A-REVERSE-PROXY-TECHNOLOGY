- oayanda-Pub-Sub-2 - 10.0.3.0/24 in Zone B
- oayanda-Pri-Sub-1 - 10.0.2.0/24 in Zone A
- oayanda-Pri-Sub-2 - 10.0.4.0/24 in Zone B
- oayanda-Pri-Sub-3 - 10.0.5.0/24 in Zone A
- oayanda-Pri-Sub-4 - 10.0.6.0/24 in Zone B

Next, attach the internet gateway to the VPC we created earlier.
On the same page click `Attach to VPC`, select the vpc and click `attach internet gateway`

Edit a route in public route table, and associate additional route for anywhere ips with the Internet Gateway. (This is what allows a public subnet to be accisble from the Internet)
Click VPC > route table , select the Public subnet. select `actions` > `edit routes`

Create 3 Elastic IPs
`VPC` > `Elastic IP addresses` > `Allocate Elastic IP address` - add a name tag and click on `allocate`
![vpc](/images/12.png)

Create a Nat Gateway and assign the Elastic IPs
Click on `VPC` > `NAT gateways` > `Create NAT gateway`

- Select a Public Subnet
- Connection Type: Public
- Allocate Elastic IP

Create a Security Group for the following

- `Nginx Servers`: Access to Nginx should only be allowed from a Application Load balancer (ALB). At this point, we have not created a load balancer, therefore we will update the rules later. For now, just create it and put some dummy records as a place holder.
- `Bastion Servers`: Access to the Bastion servers should be allowed only from workstations that need to SSH into the bastion servers. Hence, you can use your workstation public IP address. To get this information, simply go to your terminal and type curl www.canhazip.com
- `Application Load Balancer`: ALB will be available from the Internet
- `Webservers`: Access to Webservers should only be allowed from the `Nginx` servers. Since we do not have the servers created yet, just put some dummy records as a place holder, we will update it later.
- `Data Layer`: Access to the Data layer, which is comprised of `Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)` and `Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)` must be carefully desinged â€“ only `webservers` should be able to connect to `RDS`, while `Nginx` and `Webservers` will have access to `EFS` Mountpoint.
